# glinttest(1-Person Twitter App) Mobile Developer Technical Test

One person Twitter App project.

There are two pages basically.
- LoginPage- Done with firebase auth. One can create account with email and password. Already account holder can login with email and password. Also user can login using google.
- HomePage- Here we can see all the tweets of our app. User can post tweet of 280 characters. User can also edit and delete his tweet. I have implemented one extra feature. Every user can support and unsupport the tweets. The total support number will be shown also. at the top of the appbar there is a logout button for user to logout from the app.

## Image of the homepage added named "twitterglints.png" in the root folder with direction of the functionalities.
